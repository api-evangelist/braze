# Braze (braze)
The Braze and Radar integration allows you to access sophisticated location-based campaign triggers and user profile enrichment with rich, first-party location data. When Radar geofence or trip tracking events are generated, custom events and user attributes are sent to Braze in real-time. These events and attributes can then be used to trigger location-based campaigns, power last-mile pickup and delivery operations, monitor fleet and shipping logistics, or build user segments based on location patterns.
