      The Braze and Radar integration allows you to access sophisticated
      location-based campaign triggers and user profile enrichment with rich,
      first-party location data. When Radar geofence or trip tracking events are
      generated, custom events and user attributes are sent to Braze in
      real-time. These events and attributes can then be used to trigger
      location-based campaigns, power last-mile pickup and delivery operations,
      monitor fleet and shipping logistics, or build user segments based on
      location patterns.
